# Cozy Cafe Modpack
This repository is purely for the notes related to the Cozy Cafe Modpack patch notes, it's download link, and instructions on installation.

## Patch Notes (v0.5)
### General Configuration
- Enjoy 12 Additional Character Trait points during character creation! These will combine with the points already provided if you do not choose a profession. This should allow you to experiment with more traits!
- Global Chat has been disabled. Only local, faction, and radio style chats are enabled. Admins are able to utilize specific server-wide chats, if needed.
- There are no predefined spawn coordinates, but community members previously tend to start in Rosewood, unless you are itching to visit Camp Crystal Lake near Riverside
- PvP may be enabled and disabled at-will. You will not be specifically indicated in any way if in PvP mode.
- Currently, there is a 16 player limit on the server. I do not anticipate this will be an issue, but if so, it can be expanded in the future.
- Every 48 in-game hours, any container that has no items in it will spawn new items. These containers must not be player built OR contained in a building that has player construction (barricades, etc.).
- Due to changes made to skill books, the speed of reading has been slightly lowered from 1.0 to 1.15 minutes per page.
- Your survivor will get tired and require sleep. How often is largely dependent on your traits. You should be able to sleep on beds and larger furniture items, such as a couch.
- Trash Bins can be used to delete items. A "Delete All" button should be available on any trash bin. These items cannot be restored in any way.
- Players are capable of knocking each other when running through one another.
- Starting date is now May 1 at 7am, as opposed to mid-July (the default)
- Water and Electric shutdown has been extended from 0-30 days, to 2-6 months, although the exact time and date is still random.

### Zoids
- Zoids are fast, but weak and fragile.
- Zoid numbers are greater than normal!
- Zoids are much better at hearing than they are at seeing!
- Zoids can lose focus more easily if you cut off their line of sight.
- Zoids are more active at night. During the day they are slower.

## Mods
Our initial setup is largely cosmetic and Quality of Life mods, with expansions to traits, skills, and professions. There are a limited number of functional mods, though all Mods will have descriptions of their purpose outlined!

**AmmoCraft**
- Allows players to craft ammunition using casings, bullet tips, and gunpowder.

**Dante Collectables**

**Firearms**
- Adds several new firearms to the game for players to find and maintain

**First Aid Overhaul**
- Greatly expands the First Aid skill, adding new medicines and treatment options that are unlocked as your First Aid skill increases. Test on zoid corposes to further your first aid.
- Earn First Aid much faster by performing medicine on other players.
- The version used on this server does NOT have the antizen syringe, which instantly heals the Knox Virus.

**First Aid Vaccines**
- Expands the First Aid skill to allow for the development of vaccines. Take blood samples from fallen zoids, boil the samples, and put the result into syringes to administer to others.
- Vaccines are more potent and protect better the higher your First Aid level.
- Vaccines do not CURE the Knox virus, but prevent it. More potent vaccines have a higher level of protection, but your protection is not permanent.

**Fluffy Hair**
- Adds hair models and rebuilds the hair system.
- Used by other mods in this list to expand the hair options in-game

**Hemophilia**
- Adds a new trait that makes stopping bleeding take longer

**Profession Framework**
- Provides framework for new professions and changes to existing professions. Does nothing on its own.

**Schizophrenia Trait**

- Seeing a comrade die with this trait will immediately place you into mental breakdown

**Schoolbags Bundle**
- Modify your schoolbag with new styles using the crafting menu

**Shake It Up**
