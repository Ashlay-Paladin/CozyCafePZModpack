  <summary><h2>Patch Notes (v0.6.2)</h2></summary>

### Server Configuration Changes
- The virus has altered! Zoids that have lived long enough appear to have become deaf, but their vision has become rapidly better. They act more like visual hunters now.
- Zoids do not appear to migrate as they once have, repopulating areas. It seems, for now, it is possible to clear out safe spaces. Who knows for how long, though.

### Mod Changes
- **Shake It Up** and **Just Sleep** mods have been removed from the server. Neither work as intended and throw errors on boot-up, confusing players.
- **More Bags** has been patched to properly address an experience issue causing errors on boot-up. This error was not player-affecting and generally could be ignored, but better to have it patched out for clarification.
- The *Make Sack* recipe from **More Bags**, specifically, had its experience application altered. It should now properly award Tailoring experience.

### Removing Mods ðŸ“Œ
Two mods have been **removed** from this patch. This is not something I can do for you, so I will note below how to accomplish this. Note, you can avoid this entirely by deleting ALL mods from your system and applying the Full modpack, as well.
1. Open your Mods folder (based on your operating system, see [Installation Instructions](#installation) below for where to find this)
2. Select and delete the following folders: **ShakeItUp**, **just-sleep**, and **More Bags**.
3. Download the *Modpack Patch* found at [Download Links](#download).
4. Extract the modified version of **More Bags** from the modpack patch ZIP and add it to your Zomboid Mods folder from step 1.

<summary><h2>Patch Notes (v0.6)</h2></summary>

### New Mods
**Chip a Stone**: Allows players to use Hammer or Stone Hammer to turn regular Stone into Chipped Stone for spears and crafting.

**Read While Walking**: Allows players to read.. while walking. Press R to cancel reading (hotkey is configurable).

**Medicine Moodles**: New Moodles to visualize the effects of medicine, such as Beta Blockers and Antidepressents. Should help visualize when you need to take more medicine.

**Just Sleep**: Allows players to sleep regardless of pain, tiredness, panic, or when they last attempted to sleep. Prevents automatically waking up so everyone can wake at the same time.

**Sleep on It**: Sleeping slowly reduces your depression and anxiety.

**Sleep with Friends**: Adjusts sleep formula for recovery. Shortens the time necessary to sleep to recover fatigue.

**Nocturnal Zombies**: Updates to Zoid behavior at different times of night. More specific notes below.

**Reading is not Boring**: Reading *any* book will reduce boredom, including skill manuals and technical magazines.

**Read Faster While Sitting**: Plant yourself on the ground with a good book! Your read time will increase. Reading as a vehicle passenger has the same effect.

**Rain Wash**: Rain will effectively wash your character and vehicle.

**True Actions**: A series of several mods that add emotes to the game. This will also allow you to sit and lay down on furniture.

**True Crouching**: Sneaking and shooting while crouched will have better animations.

### Server Changes
- Sleeping should now take less time to reduce fatigue. It should also help with stress and depression.
- Zoids become faster, strong, and more aggressive as the night progresses from 10PM to 5AM, but begins to taper off between 5AM - 8AM.
- Due to the new reading options and bonuses, base reading speed has been decreased from 1.15 minutes per page to 2.45 minutes per page.
### Documentation Changes
- A Patch ZIP will be available for those who have already installed the original mods. This will include only the new mods and be a much smaller download.
- An updated ZIP containing ALL mods will be available for anyone joining new.

<summary><h2>Patch Notes (v0.5)</h2></summary>

### General Configuration
- Enjoy 12 Additional Character Trait points during character creation! These will combine with the points already provided if you do not choose a profession. This should allow you to experiment with more traits!
- Global Chat has been disabled. Only local, faction, and radio style chats are enabled. Admins are able to utilize specific server-wide chats, if needed.
- Regardless of spawn point chosen, players will spawn in front of the Fire Hall in Rosewood.
- PvP is enabled by default. You will not be specifically indicated in any way.
- Currently, there is a 16 player limit on the server. I do not anticipate this will be an issue, but if so, it can be expanded in the future.
- Every 48 in-game hours, any container that has no items in it will spawn new items. These containers must not be player built OR contained in a building that has player construction (barricades, etc.).
- Due to changes made to skill books, the speed of reading has been slightly lowered from 1.0 to 1.15 minutes per page.
- Your survivor will get tired and require sleep. How often is largely dependent on your traits. You should be able to sleep on beds and larger furniture items, such as a couch.
- Trash Bins can be used to delete items. A "Delete All" button should be available on any trash bin. These items cannot be restored in any way.
- Players are capable of knocking each other when running through one another.
- Starting date is now May 1 at 7am, as opposed to mid-July (the default)
- Water and Electric shutdown has been extended from 0-30 days, to 2-6 months, although the exact time and date is still random.

### Zoids
- Zoids are fast, but weak and fragile.
- Zoid numbers are greater than normal!
- Zoids are much better at hearing than they are at seeing!
- Zoids can lose focus more easily if you cut off their line of sight.
- Zoids are more active at night. During the day they are slower.
